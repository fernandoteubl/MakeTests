## JSON Config

* **Comments**: Use "//" at first position of line.

* **Multiple lines**: "key": """First Line\<breakline\>Second Line""" is equal "key": ["First Line", "Second Line"]

## List of Students

Student's list is a CSV file with delimiter and chotechar defined in JSON config.
There is no hard header name, but all headers used needs to be configured in JSON config.

# Example of use

## Create a Question's DataBase

Create directories and subdirectories of database:

```
mkdir Questions
mkdir Questions/Easy
mkdir Questions/Medium
mkdir Questions/Hard
```

Create some questions from template:

```
./MakeTests.py -e choices > Questions/Easy/choices.py
./MakeTests.py -e truefalse > Questions/Easy/truefalse.py
./MakeTests.py -e questionanswer > Questions/Medium/questionanswer.py
./MakeTests.py -e number > Questions/Medium/number.py
./MakeTests.py -e essay > Questions/Hard/essay.py
```

Edit/add/delete your questions.

## Create a config file

Create from template:

```
./MakeTests.py -e config > config.json
```

Edit `config.json` if necessary.

The template has a logo called `logo.jpeg`.
You can remove it from LaTeX template or add a logo.jpeg in img path:

```
mkdir img
curl -0 https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png -o img/logo.png
```

Create a CSV student's list file called `Students.csv`.

To genarate a random `Students.csv` file, run this script:

```
echo "%ID%;%NAME%;%EMAIL%" > Students.csv
for i in {1..30} ; do
	nw=$[RANDOM%3+2]
	name=""
	for (( i = 1; i <= $nw; i++ )); do
		set="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
		name+=${set:$RANDOM % ${#set}:1}
		set="abcdefghijklmonpqrstuvwxyz"
		n=$[RANDOM%12+4]
		for j in `seq 1 $n`; do; char=${set:$RANDOM % ${#set}:1}; name+=$char; done
		if [ $i -lt $nw ]; then; name+=" "; fi
	done
	mail=""
	set="abcdefghijklmonpqrstuvwxyz"
	n=$[RANDOM%12+4]
	for j in `seq 1 $n`; do; char=${set:$RANDOM % ${#set}:1}; mail+=$char; done
	mail+="@"
	for j in `seq 1 $n`; do; char=${set:$RANDOM % ${#set}:1}; mail+=$char; done
	mail+=".com"
	echo "$[RANDOM%100000000+100000000];\"$name\";$mail" >> Students.csv
done
```

## Generate PDFs

Just run:

`MakeTests.py`

You can add `-v` or `-vv` to most verbose.

## Print and Apply

Print the `Tests.pdf` using duplex option (double side).

The `Template.pdf` is optional.

## Correcting

### Using WebCAM

Just run:

`MakeTesta.py -w 0`

*NOTE: Try -w 1, -w 2, ... to select the correct WebCam*

Point the camera at the questions!

### Using PDF Scanned

Scans all tests in a single PDF.

```
./Maketests.py -p <name_of_scanned_tests_file.pdf>
```

If you have more than one PDF, execute multiple times to append all scores and feedbacks.

Some PDFs format is incompatible with MakeTests.
If an error occurs, try to convert the PDF using `convertPdfText2PdfImage.sh` and try again.

**All scores and feedback will be on Correction folder.**

## Send Feedback

Create a `mail.json` file:

```
./SendMail.py -e > mail.json
```

Edit this file using this template:

```json
{
	"input": "Correction/_scores.csv",
	"delimiter":";",
	"quotechar": "\"",
	"multiple_recipients_separator": ",",

	"sender": "login@server.com",
	"SMTP_server": "smtp.server.com",
	"SMTP_port": "587",
	"SMTP_login": "login@server.com",
//	"SMTP_password": "Your plain password :( ... Leave this commented to ask while running, without storage it."
	"subject": "Your final score is Final_Score",
	"message": """Hi Fullname,
	your score:
		Question 1: Question_1
		Question 2: Question_2
		Question 3: Question_3
		Question 4: Question_4
		Final Score: Final_Score

	Attached, your feedback.

	If you have any questions, please contact me.
""",

	"columns": {
		"email": "EMail",
		"attachment": "Fullname"
	},
	"filter": """def filter(data):
	for header,cell in data.row.items():
		if cell == '':
			return False
	return True
"""
}
```

Change the template above with you SMTP info.

**IMPORTANT:** Use a STARTTLS port.

**TIP:** Create another config file (e.g.: `mail_no_score.json`) and use it to send mail to specific students with no scores (or low scores) just changing the filter code.

# Errors and solutions

**Error:** LaTeX error, no idea.

**Solution:**
1. Create a folder called tex;
1. Include -t tex as parameter;
1. Run `pdftex` manually and see the tex source.

**Error:** There is a %SOMETHING% in LaTeX.

**Solution:** Check the Students.csv header. Some variable is wrong and wasn't replaced.
